# Introduction

### What you will learn and why
Why you should use Targets:

* maintain a *reproducible workflow* 
* *save costly runtime* for tasks that are already up to date
* *provide evidence* that output aligns with the code and data

***

What you will learn in this workshop: 

* How to build a pipeline of custom functions using  `tar_script()` , `tar_edit()`and `tar_target()`
* How to visualize dependencies using `tar_visnetwork()` & `tar_manifest()`
* How to run your pipeline using  `tar_make()`
* How to  check for outdated targets using `tar_outdated()`
* How to access targets to work with them using `tar_read()`and  `tar_load()`
* How to monitor data files for changes by establishing them as targets

### A pipeline of functions, the Targets' Philosophy

A pipeline contains tasks to prepare datasets, run models, and summarize results for a business deliverable or research paper. The methods behind these tasks are user-defined R functions that live in R scripts, ideally in a folder called "3-R/" in the project. The tasks themselves are called “targets”, and they run the functions and return R objects. The targets package orchestrates the targets and stores the output objects to make your pipeline efficient, painless, and reproducible.

# Setup

Before we get started please run this chunk to load packages and delete any existing targets. 

```{r message=FALSE, comment=F}
pacman::p_load(kableExtra,
               tidyverse,
               targets,
               nycflights13,
               modelsummary
)
df<-nycflights13::flights

#loading custom functions for the analysis
source("3-R/1-functions.R")

#loading scripts necessary for the quiz in workshop
source("3-R/4-answers_to_questions.R")
source("3-R/5-quiz.R")
#getting our data to the file
write.csv(df,"2-data\\nyc_flights.csv", row.names = FALSE)

tar_destroy() # Start fresh, write 1 on the prompt in your console 
```

# Building a pipiline of custom functions




### Functions

The commands of your targets will depend on the functions from `1-functions.Rmd`. For the exercises below, they are in `3-R/1-functions.R`. 
Take a quick glance at `3-R/functions.R` familiarize yourself with the code base. 

### Start with a small pipeline.

The first version of the pipeline consists of three *targets*, or steps of computation. Our first targets do the following:

1. Reproducibly track the NYC flights data file.
2. Read in the data from the CSV file.
3. Build a simple linear model predicting delays.
4. Plot the model 
5. Report results


These steps are defined as custom functions in the `1-functions.Rmd`

### The `_targets.R` file
***

To initiate our targets, we express the computation in a special configuration file called `_targets.R` which has to be at the project's root directory. 
This file is necessary to: 

1. Load any functions and global objects that the targets depend on.
2. Set any options, including packages that the targets depend on.
3. Declare a list of targets using `tar_target()`. The `_targets.R` script must always end with a list of target objects.

You would create this file from scratch using the `tar_script()` command. 


```{r, fig.align='center', echo=F, out.width = "90%"}
#we could include a annotated picture of the tar_make file here

#  knitr::include_graphics("")
```


We have prepared and initial file for you here which you will edit throughout the workshop. 
Run the following code chunk to put our prepared  `_targets.R` file for this chapter in your working directory.


```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
file.copy("3-R/2-initial_targets.R", "_targets.R", overwrite = TRUE)

```


Now, open `_targets.R` in the RStudio  for editing. Exercises later in this chapter will ask you to make changes to this file. 

```{r}
tar_edit()
```



### Visualizing dependencies  |  `tar_visnetwork()` & `tar_manifest()` 

The `targets` package detects the relationships between targets automatically using static code analysis.

`tar_visnetwork()` includes functions in the dependency graph, as well as color-coded status information.
```{r}
tar_visnetwork()

```

While `tar_manifest()` provides a dataframe of your targets and its meta data e.g. name , R-command that runs it or its deployment priority.
```{r, message = FALSE}
tar_manifest()
```



# Running the pipeline | `tar_make()`

So far we have been working on Set-up ...`tar_make()` actually runs the pipeline. 
It creates reproducible process that executes the targets in the `_targets.R` - file in the correct order (see the  dependency graph).

```{r}
get_data <- function(file) {
  read_csv(file, col_types = cols())
}
```


```{r}
tar_make()
```


# Accessing Targets | `tar_read()`and  `tar_load()`
There are other functions to access the targets and work with them in R or to report them. 


`tar_read()` reads a targets return value from, its file. For dynamik files it returns their path. 
```{r}
tar_read(run_lm)
```
`tar_read()` is useful to assign the target to a new object in case you want to work with it in R. 
```{r}
linear_model<-tar_read(run_lm)
mod_metrics(linear_model)
```


`tar_load()` loads the return values of a given target from its storage in _targets/objects.
```{r}
tar_load(run_lm)
```



# Checking for outdated targets | `tar_outdated()`

`tar_outdated()` checks the dependencies and data of targets and returns a list of outdated targets. 
If it returns 0 all our targets are up to date. 
```{r}
tar_outdated()
```

# Data files as targets 

In the targets scrip you can also specify a file as a target. In fact that is what we did with the *NYC-Flights* data set with `format = "file"` in `tar_target()`. This way any changes to the data set should trigger the target and all targets that depend on it to become outdated. 
`tar_read()` returns the path for these types of targets [targets with ].

```{r}
tar_read(flights_file)
```


#Questions 
 **1. What do you see when you open `_targets.R` using the chunk below? **

```{r}
tar_edit()
```


**A.** A call to `source("3-changes/functions.R")` to load our custom functions. <br>
**B.** A call to `tar_option_set()` to declare the packages the targets need when they run.<br>
**C.** The full pipeline from `2-pipelines.Rmd` at the very bottom of the file.<br>
**D.** All the above.<br>

```{r}
answer_1_setup("E") # Give your own answer here.
```

**2. Which target runs first when running the pipeline with `tar_make()`.Why?**

**A.** `flights_data`, because the rest of the targets depend on it. <br>
**B.** `flights_file`, because the rest of the targets depend on it.<br>
**C.** `flights_data`, because it appears first in `_targets.R`.<br> 
**D.** `flights_file`, because it appears first in `_targets.R`.
 
```{r}
answer1_first("E") # Give your own answer here.
```

Check the chunk below to see:
```{r}
tar_make()
```


**3. If you load the `run_lm` target from the `_targets/` data store using the `tar_load()` function and print it. What do you observe?**

**A.** A function. <br>
**B.** A fitted lm model. <br>
**C.** A one-row data frame. <br>
**D.** A plot  objects. <br>

```{r}
answer1_inspect("E")
```



#  Exercises: adding to the pipeline 


**1. Add a plot target and visualize your new target dependencies. **


```{r eval=FALSE}
tar_edit()
```

```{r}
# write your code here
```


**2.Delete last row from the CSV file & check which targets are outdated and why.**

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
"2-data/nyc_flights.csv" %>%
  read_csv(col_types = cols()) %>%
  head(n = nrow(.) - 1) %>%
  write_csv("2-data/nyc_flights.csv")
```



**A.** All of them. `targets` notices it has been a while since you ran the pipeline.<br>
**B.** All of them. The data file changed, and `targets` automatically knows `Data/nyc_flights.csv` is a data file.<br>
**C.** All of them. The data file changed, and the pipeline is configured to automatically track `data/churn.csv`. The pipeline tracks the data file because the `churn_file` target returns the value `"Data/nyc_flights.csv"` and the call to `tar_target()` has `format = "file"`. <br>
**D.** None of them, because `Data/nyc_flights.csv` is neither a target nor a function in the global environment. <br>

```{r}
answer1_outdated("E")
```

Check using chunk below.
```{r}
tar_outdated()
```

**3. Open `R/1-functions.R` and change the plot function, specifically change "c = 'red1'" argument. **

```{r eval=FALSE}
file.edit('3-R/1-functions.R')
```

**Rerun the pipeline.**

```{r }
tar_make()
```

**Which targets ran? Why?**

**A.** None. No target directly calls `plotting`. <br>
**B.** None. The model definition did not change much. <br>
**C.** `run_lm`, as plotting depends on it. <br>
**D.** Only `plotting` as no other targets depend on it. <br>


**6. Make a meaningless change to the modeling in the Functions.RMD [eg. delete a white space or add an empty line]**

```{r eval=FALSE}
file.edit('3-R/1-functions.R')
```

**Which targets will re-run and  Why?**

**A.** `run_lm`and `plotting`,as the `run_lmodel()` function changed, which affects all these targets. <br>
**B.** None. `tar_make()` ignores trivial changes like comments and white space. <br>
**C.** None. `tar_make()` ignores all changes to functions.<br>
**D.** None. No target directly calls `run_model()`.<br>

```{r}
answer1_trivial("E")
```


Check using chunk below.
```{r}
tar_outdated()
```
